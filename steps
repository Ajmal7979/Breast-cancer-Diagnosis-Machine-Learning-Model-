steps : 

1. Loads and preprocesses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
2. Applies Standard Scaling and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
3. Trains Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.
4. Uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of the SVM model.
5. Evaluates models with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
